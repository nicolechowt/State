# Project 1 - {State - A Health Tracker}

## Project Scope
Application will combine manually entered user input and data from a hardware piece to submit a comprehensive user profile to “doctors”.
Allow users to easily log and track their symptoms. Help users find a pattern or commonality between episodes. This can be done by analyzing previously stored data, both inputted by user and through Fitbit/weather APIs.
